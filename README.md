🖥️ Unsafe Sitting Distacne
This project implements a real-time system using OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect if a user is sitting too close to their monitor. The program provides a visual warning and plays a beep sound when the user's face is detected too close to the screen. It's designed to help promote better posture and reduce eye strain while working at a computer.

Features

🛑 Proximity Warning: Displays a warning message on the screen if the user is too close.
🔊 Audio Alert: Plays a beep sound when the proximity threshold is exceeded.
